  return `${skillFrontmatter(config)}# Document-to-Question Skill — ${config.name}

This skill converts source documents (exam papers, worksheets, assessments)
into the question-bank's structured JSON import format, for **this specific
course only**. It combines the general extraction process with the exact
structure, categories, and rules ${config.name} uses — do not apply this to a
different course without downloading that course's own skill file, since
node ids, question types, and difficulty labels are course-specific and
will not resolve against another course's database.

## Process

1. Read the entire source document before extracting anything, so multi-part
   questions, shared stems, and diagrams referenced across pages are handled
   correctly rather than piecemeal.
2. Identify each individual question (or question with parts). Preserve the
   original question numbering only as source metadata — never let it drive
   the app's own display order.
3. For each question, extract in order: question text, equations (as LaTeX),
   diagrams/images (describe what should be extracted; this skill cannot
   extract binary image data itself), tables (as structured
   columns/rows, not flattened text), and lists. Whenever a question needs a
   diagram/image that can't be extracted, **keep a running note of its
   original question number** so you can report it in the Image attachment
   checklist (see below).
   **Format mathematical notation, scientific notation, symbols, and units
   for rendering.** Use an equation block for standalone equations. For math
   inside prose, choices, table cells, or list items, wrap LaTeX in single
   dollar signs, e.g. $v = 3.0\\times10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$. Never leave
   powers as plain 10^8 or use plain x for multiplication.
   If completing a question requires follow-up input or action from the person
   (for example, manually attaching an image that could not be extracted), add
   the exact tag \`action_required\` to that question's \`tags\` array. Do not add
   it to questions that need no follow-up.
4. Determine the question type, difficulty, marks, and classification
   (course nodes) using the course-specific section below — never guess a
   category that doesn't appear in "VALID NODES"; if uncertain, use the
   nearest matching node's parent instead of inventing one, and note the
   classification confidence honestly.
5. **Every question must end up with a marking guide** (see "Marking guides"
   below) — this is not optional, even when the source material doesn't
   include one.
6. Produce a single JSON file (see "Output format") containing every
   extracted question. Do not import anything yourself — the person uploads
   this file into the app.

## Image attachment checklist

Because this skill extracts text, equations, tables, and lists but **cannot
extract binary image data**, every finished response must end with an
**Image attachment checklist** that tells the person exactly which questions
need images attached and where they are in the source. This is not optional
— it is the only way the person knows what's missing.

- Track every question needing manual attachment **by its original source
  question number** (the same number you put in each question's
  \`source.original_question_no\`), plus its part label if it's a multi-part
  question — the app's question ids don't exist yet, so question numbers are
  the only reliable reference.
- End the response with a checklist like this:

\`\`\`
## Image attachment checklist

- Q17 (b): circuit diagram — two long parallel wires above a rectangular loop, AC source
- Q22: force-vs-time graphs A\u2013D for the rocket's thrust
- Q34: scatter plot of V0/V vs 1/\u03bb with five data points
\`\`\`

- If no question needs an image, still include the section and write
  "None — every question is fully text/equations." A missing section reads
  as an omission, not as "none needed".
- The person attaches these via the app's block editor upload picker after
  import.

## Marking guides — required, and never an exemplar

Every question in the output must have a \`marking_criteria\` field (in
addition to \`answer\`/\`solution\` if the source provides them):

- If the source document already gives marking criteria (a rubric, a mark
  scheme, "1 mark for X, 1 mark for Y"), use it as given, reworded into the
  block format below if needed.
- **If the exam document gives no marking criteria, create them yourself**
  for every question or part, using the question wording, its marks value,
  difficulty, and course context (topic/dot point) to decide what a response
  must demonstrate to earn each mark. For example, a 3-mark short-answer
  question might earn "1 mark for
  correctly identifying X; 1 mark for the correct method; 1 mark for the
  correct final answer with appropriate units."
- **Do not write a full worked exemplar answer or model solution as the
  marking guide.** A marking guide describes what to check for and how marks
  are allocated — it is a checklist for a marker, not a sample response. If
  you also have or can produce a worked solution, put that in the separate
  \`solution\` field instead; keep \`marking_criteria\` focused on grading
  criteria only.
- Marking criteria should be given as a \`list\` content block (one item per
  criterion/mark) wherever practical, since that's the clearest format for a
  marker to check off against.
- **Every criterion item must state its mark allocation up front** — the app
  renders the marking guide as a two-column table (criteria | marks), so
  write each item as \`"<allocation> marks: <what to look for>"\` (or
  \`"<allocation> marks for <what to look for>"\`), allocating a single mark
  or a band, e.g. \`"1 mark: correctly identifies X"\`, \`"2 marks: sets up
  the correct equation"\`, or \`"1–2 marks: partial method with one slip"\`.
  A trailing parenthesised allocation (\`"... correctly (2 marks)"\`) also
  works. Avoid vague criteria with no allocation — an unmallocated line
  shows an empty marks cell in the table.

## Output format

Produce **one JSON file** (e.g. \`import.json\`) shaped like this:

\`\`\`json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "course_id": "${config.course_id}",
  "course_name": "${config.name}",
  "questions": [
    {
      "type_key": "short_answer",
      "difficulty": 3,
      "marks": 3,
      "node_ids": ["<a valid node_id from import-schema.json>"],
      "node_codes": ["<the matching code from import-schema.json for the node_id above>"],
      "tags": ["optional", "free-text", "action_required"],
      "body": [
        {"block_type": "text", "content": {"text": "..."}},
        {"block_type": "equation", "content": {"latex": "x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0", "display": true}}
      ],
      "answer": [{"block_type": "text", "content": {"text": "..."}}],
      "solution": [],
      "marking_criteria": [
        {"block_type": "list", "content": {"ordered": false, "items": [
          "1 mark: correctly extracts the coefficients",
          "1 mark: applies the quadratic formula correctly",
          "1 mark: correct final answer"
        ]}}
      ],
      "classification_confidence": "high",
      "source": {"name": "Trial Examination", "year": 2025, "original_question_no": "17"}
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

## Multiple-choice questions

For every question whose \`type_key\` is \`multiple_choice\`, keep the question
stem in \`body\` and put answer choices in a separate \`mcq_options\` array. Do
not put choices in a body list. Keep stem blocks in the order they appear on
the page, and keep options in their printed order (A, B, C, D). Each option
has a \`content\` array of normal content blocks and an \`is_correct\` boolean.
Use inline LaTeX for math in option text. Mark exactly one option correct
when the source establishes the answer; also set \`answer\` to its letter (for
example, \`C\`). If the source does not establish the answer, set every
\`is_correct\` to \`false\` and leave \`answer\` empty rather than guessing.
Preserve diagrams, tables, and equations in the stem or option content where
they occur. Do not create question parts for the choices.

Example:

\`\`\`json
{
  "type_key": "multiple_choice",
  "body": [{"block_type": "text", "content": {"text": "What is the temperature?"}}],
  "mcq_options": [
    {"content": [{"block_type": "text", "content": {"text": "$1.6\\\\times10^{12}$ K"}}], "is_correct": false},
    {"content": [{"block_type": "text", "content": {"text": "$5.2\\\\times10^{3}$ K"}}], "is_correct": true}
  ],
  "answer": [{"block_type": "text", "content": {"text": "B"}}]
}
\`\`\`

Fill in \`source.original_question_no\` for **every** question (and give each
multi-part part a \`part_label\`) — the Image attachment checklist references
questions by these same numbers, so they must match exactly what's printed
on the source paper.

See \`import-schema.json\` (packaged alongside this file) for this course's
actual valid \`node_ids\`, \`node_codes\`, \`node_names\`, \`type_key\` values,
and difficulty range (${diffRange}) — every \`node_ids\` entry in your output
must be one of the \`node_id\` values listed there, with its matching
\`node_codes\` entry (the \`code\` on the same row), and every \`type_key\`
must be one of the listed valid types.

**Always fill in both \`node_ids\` and \`node_codes\`, and include
\`course_name\`.** Course and node ids are regenerated whenever the course is
re-imported (e.g. after a reset), but node \`code\`s, the course
\`course_name\`, and the full node paths in \`node_names\` (e.g. \`Module /
Topic / Subtopic\` from \`valid_node_names\`) stay stable. Including them lets
the app re-match questions to the correct nodes even after the ids change, and
lets the file be matched to a re-created course by name. Quote the ids, codes,
names, and course name exactly as shown in \`import-schema.json\`.

Content block types available for \`body\`/\`answer\`/\`solution\`/\`marking_criteria\`:
\`text\`, \`heading\`, \`equation\` (LaTeX in \`latex\`, \`display\`),
\`image\`/\`diagram\`/\`graph\` (include the image description in the content
and flag the question in the Image attachment checklist — see step 3),
\`table\` (\`columns\`, \`rows\`), \`list\` (\`ordered\`, \`items\`), \`code\`
(\`language\`, \`code\`), \`answer_area\` (\`lines\`), \`page_break\`.

## Handling uncertainty

- Multi-part questions: emit one question object for the shared stem, with
  a \`parts\` array of \`{"part_label": "a", "marks": ..., "body": [...],
  "marking_criteria": [...]}\` objects — do not split them into unrelated
  top-level questions. A part may itself contain a \`parts\` array using the
  same object shape for nested labels (for example, question 26 has part \`c\`,
  whose parts are \`i\` and \`ii\`). Keep each level nested under its immediate
  parent: represent this as 26 → c → i/ii, not as flat labels such as \`c(i)\`.
- For multi-part \`extended_response\`, \`short_response\`, or \`short_answer\`
  questions, include an \`answer_area\` block at the end of each part's \`body\`
  so answer lines appear immediately after that part. Set \`content.lines\` to
  two lines per mark (round fractional results up, with at least one line),
  based on that part's \`marks\`; for example, a 2-mark part gets
  \`{"block_type":"answer_area","content":{"lines":4}}\`. Do not put one
  long answer area on the shared parent question. Leave answer areas off
  multiple-choice parts and parts whose source already provides a specific
  answer space.
- If a question spans multiple valid nodes, list all of them in \`node_ids\`
  (and the matching codes in \`node_codes\`) — only if the course allows
  multiple classification — see below.
- If you cannot confidently classify a question at all, still include it,
  set \`classification_confidence\` to \`"low"\`, and pick the closest available
  node rather than leaving \`node_ids\` empty.
